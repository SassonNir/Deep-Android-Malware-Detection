## How to run the code

Given an existing dataset directory (see below for details), the run.sh file will do the following:

1. Partition the dataset into training-set and held-out test-set
2. Train a neural network
3. Test the trained network on the test-set

## Prerequisites

### Dataset structure

An example dataset with the required directory structure is provided in ./dataset 

The neural network requires opcode sequence files in the correct format, and a dataset directory with sub-directories containing malware and benign opcode sequence files.

An example dataset directory is provided in ./dataset. The dataset directory must have the following structure:

1. There must be a directory called 'Benign', and contains non-malware opcode sequences files
2. The other directory can have any name ,and contains malware opcode sequence files

### Opcode Sequence files

Opcode sequence files can be created from android APK files using the opcode sequence creation tool. This tool is located in ./opcodeseq_creator Please see the readme file in this directory for more information.

### Setup

The neural network code is implemented using Torch. It is recommended to use a GPU to achieve acceleration of testing and training. For details on installing Torch please see http://torch.ch

The opcode sequence creator tool requires APKTool https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/
